## Current Projects

#### ![ntfyme_16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e7d3239-2d0a-4919-a5c5-8b2790886fd5) ntfyme (under active development)

The unofficial [ntfy.sh](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) browser extension for receiving & sending ntfy notifications in real-time using SSE and http connections. Feature packed to include virtually almost every option available for ntfy.sh notifications (tags, titles, delay, click urls, icon urls, file urls, local file attachments, markdown formatting, caching options, and more). Some additional features include an all-inclusive list of themes to make your ntfy extension yours, AES encryption for storing your ntfy server credentials and user settings in the browser.storage.sync API, receiving from and sending to multiple topics at the same time, configuring message defaults including adding the current tab's url if you want, and more. Planning to release to chrome and firefox extension stores at the end of 2024! Make sure to be on the lookout üòÄ (Vue3, Vite, Typescript, DaisyUI)
